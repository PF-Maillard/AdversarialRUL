# Adversarial Predictive Maintenance

## About

This repository contains the implementation code for the "Adversarial Predictive Maintenance". The repository is dedicated to developing adversarial methods to deceive predictive maintenance systems. The implemented methods include the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Basic Iterative Method (BIM), Carlini & Wagner (CW) attack L2, and the Minimal-L0 method (L0). The tests have been done considering the dataset: NASA Turbofan Jet Engine Data Set.

Note the utiliza    tion of the following repository: 
- RUL Predictions using PyTorch LSTM: https://www.kaggle.com/code/jinsolkwon/rul-predictions-using-pytorch-lstm/notebook 

## Procedure

You must manually download the NASA Turbofan Jet Engine dataset and place it in the "DatasetRUL" folder. The dataset is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/behrad3d/nasa-cmaps. We only consider the first TurboFan for experiments
